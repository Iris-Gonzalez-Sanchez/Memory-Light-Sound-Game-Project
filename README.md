## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
 For CSS Purposes: [https://encycolorpedia.com]
                    https://imagecolorpicker.com/color-code/2596be
                    https://www.tutorialbrain.com/css_tutorial/css_font_family_list/
 For JS Purposes: [https://www.the-art-of-web.com/javascript/creating-sounds/]                  


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
 I recently learned of this opportunity and started my application process nearing the deadline, so I did not have enough time to explore more possibilities with the code.  
Time management was essential in my case; implementing the requirements as detailed for this pre-work was my number one priority. I allotted sufficient time to grasp the code needed for this submission, then divided the time I would spend for each step. It helped me to keep a physical timer nearby to check my progress. Once I was assured all my code was functioning as required, I implemented some CSS elements that suited my taste. With the deadline nearing, I also limited how much I played with my code. This was a mental challenge for me, as this submission would not convey my creativity. I would have liked to implement additional features later to match the level of originality I am capable of.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Will we learn best practices when initiating the research-process? I didn't get a chance to do any outside research from the added links your pre-work included (just for times sake), and I hope in the future to incorporate some cool elements.
How long does one web development project take to complete from start to finish? What would a bigger scope project look like in a team setting? How is the work distributed? 
How do you keep up with the latest developments in web development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would have enjoyed making this game harder by shuffling the buttons every turn. I think this element would be more likely to stump people that use placement as a measure of pattern. I would have also liked to implement some more JS functions that sped up the sound played per round. Since it is a light and sound game, I would even implement some "fake" indicators of light to the game before a sound starts playing.
